Never ctrl+Z when packing, unpacking and parsing files

BUG: a strange situation: a few .gz.txt among all .gz.txt.gz files 
work-arounds: check whether this file exists before packing
BUG: a few files are not downloaded
solve: download all files twice to minimize the possibility of missed files
---------------------------------------------------------------
The time cost of testing whether the updates are normal is less than half the time of unpacking and packing the update files.
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are some update files where there is a blank line between two successive updates
