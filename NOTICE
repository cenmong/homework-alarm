Never ctrl+Z when packing, unpacking and parsing files

----------------------------------------------------------------
2014-12-20
BUG: a strange situation: a few .gz.txt among all .gz.txt.gz files 
work-arounds: check whether this file exists before packing
BUG: a few files are not downloaded
solve: download all files twice to minimize the possibility of missed files
however, problem remains
question: we didn't download it or it is deleted when comparing sizes
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are some update files where there are blank lines between two successive updates
---------------------------------------------------------------
Note: do not put everything into log, which makes the log file extremely large
Besides, logging costs much time! do not log frequently!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: RV2 peers' prefix quantity quite small in a certain RIB
--------------------------------------------------------------
Once apon a time, archive.routeviews.org fail to work, while routeviews.org can
However now the latter fails in IPv6 but the former can in both
--------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: sometimes when downloading an update file, the program looks like has stoped
-------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: cannot parse a certain file (program cannot stop)
