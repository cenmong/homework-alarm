BUG: a strange situation: a few .gz.txt among all .gz.txt.gz files 
work-arounds: check whether this file exists before packing
BUG: a few files are not downloaded
solve: download all files twice to minimize the possibility of missed files
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are some update files where there is a blank line between two successive updates
---------------------------------------------------------------
Note: do not put everything into log, which makes the log file extremely large
---------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: RV2 peers' prefix quantity quite small
--------------------------------------------------------------
Once apon a time, archive.routeviews.org fail to work, while routeviews.org can
However now the latter fail in IPv6 but the former can in both

FIXME should download a RIB of resonable size: not too big & small
