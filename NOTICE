BUG: a strange situation: a few .gz.txt among all .gz.txt.gz files 
work-arounds: check whether this file exists before packing
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are few files where there are blank lines between two successive updates
---------------------------------------------------------------
Note: do not put everything into log, which makes the log file extremely large
Besides, logging costs much time! do not log frequently!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: RV2 peers' prefix quantity quite small in a certain RIB
--------------------------------------------------------------
Once apon a time, archive.routeviews.org fail to work, while routeviews.org can
However now the latter fails in IPv6 but the former can in both
--------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: sometimes when downloading an update file, the program looks like has stoped
inspect: may due to too many tcp connections
-------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: cannot parse a certain file (program cannot stop)
------------------------------------------------------------------
when viewing a long line, vim can become very slow...
----------------------------------------------------------------
Never press ctrl+Z, use ctrl+C instead
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Interesing fact:
File size (write diresctly into .gz) slightly < file size (gzip a text file)
---------------------------------------------------------------
strange: ll and os.getsize show different results? (CHECK AGAIN!!!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: if a peer is too strange or active, we can dismiss it from analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: according to limited sampling, if the date of a RRC/RV update file is X minutes, then the updates inside the file
could be as early as X(for rrc)and X~X+several seconds(for RV), and as late as X+4:99/5(for rrc) and X + 15 seconds(For RV)
In conclusion, the date time of the updates will be always within the confine of the file name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: run delete reset program only once; running it multiple times may cause over-deletion
